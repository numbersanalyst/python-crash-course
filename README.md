Through this course I created a modern Django web application with Bootstrap 5 styles. For more information, see my other repository for this project: [learning-log](https://github.com/numbersanalyst/learning-log).

## Exercises

I've done a tons of exercises to practice the knownleage on my own.

## Note
I've decided to skip some part of that book because it was boring for me. I've already learned it. So I think it's a little useless to learn something, that is easy for us.
